# mallet-lda

This project is a minimal Clojure wrapper over the LDA topic modeling
implementation from [MALLET], the MAchine Learning for LanguagE
Toolkit.

## Installation

mallet-lda is alpha-quality software. There is no artifact at the moment;
use a
[checkout dependency](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/TUTORIAL.md#checkout-dependencies)
if you want to try it out.

Feedback and pull requests welcome!

## Usage

```clojure
(let [data [{1: ["a" "little" "lamb"]
             2: ["row" "your" "boat"]}]
      instance-list (make-instance-list data)]
  (lda instance-list))
```

## TODO

Write an idiomatic wrapper over the return value of `(lda)`.
